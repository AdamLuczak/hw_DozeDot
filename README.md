## Overview
The *DozeDot* is a compact and versatile module featuring the ATTiny816 microcontroller, powered by a CR2032 battery. This board is designed with power efficiency in mind, primarily operating in a sleep mode and waking up to perform specific tasks. It includes RX/TX serial ports, an I2C bus, and two pins for touch detection. The board also features two user LEDs (userLED and sysLED), a transistor-based buzzer control circuit for piezoelectric buzzers, and can be externally powered apart from its built-in CR battery.

The ATTiny816 at the heart of DozeDot offers 8 KB of Flash memory, 512 bytes of SRAM, and 128 bytes of EEPROM, making it capable of handling a variety of tasks while maintaining low power consumption. Its 20 MHz maximum clock speed ensures responsive performance in applications requiring quick wake-up and processing.
